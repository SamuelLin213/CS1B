Description: Ok, first of all, do not freak out and think you must have these modules fully working. For this assignment, you are only implementing the navigation portion of the Serendipity menu system as described in the enclosed Chapter 1-2 pdf's and finally a small amount of test data (local variables) for the cashier as detailed in Chapter 3 pdf. No arrays (yet). This is the same assignment that I give my CS 1A class the 1 week. It is only used as a starting point for the semester long project.

You may choose to implement them as 5 separate programs or 1 large program.  The screens have already been designed, so your primary task is to write the C++ code that displays them and navigates based on the user input. Each choice should clear the screen using system("cls") prior to displaying the new menu which is included in <windows.h>.
